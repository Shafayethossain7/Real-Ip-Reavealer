# Real-Ip-Reavealer
Real-IP Revealer is a simple yet powerful tool for Kali Linux that helps uncover the real IP address behind websites or domains, even if they're protected by firewalls or proxies. By just entering a domain, the tool sends pings, checks public data, and can use Nslookup and Whois (optional) to reveal the true Ip.
